Create indexes in database:
   Assertion.subject1
   Assertion.subject2
   (Assertion.subject1, Assertion.value)   ???
   (Assertion.subject2, Assertion.value)   ???
Assertion.Value should point into a table rather than be a text

* Pedigree View
** BACK button should go back to previous pedigree view
   Or perhaps use the area on the right to show the history
** Dnd on Pedigree icon should display the pedigree for that person
** Should cache pedigree data locally to avoid reloading when going back
   (perhaps only save a few generations, although this is not big)
** Allow user to configure number of generations
** When showing children, show the name of the matching spouse
** Support for multiple parents (foster parents, ambiguities,...)
** Search for parents in aliases personas
** Display marriage dates
** "father of" and "mother of" are incorrect. They should be links to an
   event with the appropriate roles
** Make pedigree configurable:
   Chose which events to show in each boxes ("birth" and "death" by default,
   but should fallback on "baptism" and "burial" for instance, or the user
   might want to see other info (if "residence", there can be multiple of
   them)
** Children should be sorted by date of birth (the current implementation
   is incorrect since the format of the date depends on how the date was
   entered -- we should use event.date_sort rather than event.date, but use
   the latter when displaying)
