Create indexes in database:
   Assertion.subject1
   Assertion.subject2
   (Assertion.subject1, Assertion.value)   ???
   (Assertion.subject2, Assertion.value)   ???
Assertion.Value should point into a table rather than be a text

* Pedigree View
** BACK button should go back to previous pedigree view
   Or perhaps use the area on the right to show the history
   In fact, when changing the current de cujus, we should highlighting in
   the next pedigree the child or parent on which we should click to get
   back to the previous view (the previous de cujus might not be visible)
** Dnd on Pedigree icon should display the pedigree for that person
** Should cache pedigree data locally to avoid reloading when going back
   (perhaps only save a few generations, although this is not big)
** When showing children, show the name of the matching spouse
** Support for multiple parents (foster parents, ambiguities,...)
** Search for parents in aliases personas
** Make pedigree configurable:
   Chose which events to show in each boxes ("birth" and "death" by default,
   but should fallback on "baptism" and "burial" for instance, or the user
   might want to see other info (if "residence", there can be multiple of
   them)

* FanChart
** BUG: why isn't the font size taken into account in SVG ?
   Later generations should be using a smaller font-size
** Display SOSA number related to a given person
   Not necessarily related to the current root

* Ideas for names
** Geneatica, Forebears
