Create indexes in database:
   Assertion.subject1
   Assertion.subject2
   (Assertion.subject1, Assertion.value)   ???
   (Assertion.subject2, Assertion.value)   ???
Assertion.Value should point into a table rather than be a text
** We no longer see javascript errors ???

* Pedigree View
** BACK button should go back to previous pedigree view
** Should cache pedigree data locally to avoid reloading when going back
   (perhaps only save a few generations, although this is not big)
** Allow user to configure number of generations
** When showing children, show the name of the matching spouse
** Display in bold only the De Cujus, others not in bold
** Show animation when clicking on a box
