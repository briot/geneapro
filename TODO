* Database
** Create indexes in database:
   Assertion.subject1
   Assertion.subject2
   (Assertion.subject1, Assertion.value)   ???
   (Assertion.subject2, Assertion.value)   ???
   Assertion.Value should point into a table rather than be a text
** Investigate storing trees more efficiently
   See for instance http://articles.sitepoint.com/print/hierarchical-data-database
   and http://code.google.com/p/django-mptt/

* Trees
** Look at H-Trees for efficient visualization

  http://rootstech.org/schedule/saturday/TD044

* Gedcom import
** Import all missing GEDCOM information (reported by ./manage.py import)
** TODO share NOTE, PLAC and SOUR in the database
   At least when they are shared in Gedcom, and if possible more
** some INDI end up with a non-empty description, which is a xref to a NOTE.
   We should create a proper note instead (but not clear how this is done in
   GENTECH)
** Option to capitalize last names, instead of preserving capitals from some
   gedcoms.
** See invalid tags list
http://www.beholdgenealogy.com/blog/?p=876

* Pedigree View
** Dnd on Pedigree icon should display the pedigree for that person
** When showing children, show the name of the matching spouse
** Support for multiple parents (foster parents, ambiguities,...)
** Make pedigree configurable:
   Chose which events to show in each boxes ("birth" and "death" by default,
   but should fallback on "baptism" and "burial" for instance, or the user
   might want to see other info (if "residence", there can be multiple of
   them) See also engagement instead of marriage
** Tooltip to display person info
** Display more information for each person, in particular when zooming
** Highlight box when hover.
   Display action buttons ("make decujus", "view info",...) for the active box.
   Use a R-Tree for fast detection.
** Compact layout should compute width of boxes in one generation by looking
   at the maximum width to display the info.
** control-click does not work on Firefox/OSX

** Dynamic "infinite" expansion
See "Interactive Visualization of Genealogical Graphs"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ1GXZ0hJPY
* Highlight rules
** Store them in the database
** Create them graphically
** Use presets

* Quilts
** Selection seems to stop after a few generations
** Filtering to only show persons related to the current selection.
   Should auto zoom to make the selection visible.
** Easy navigation to parents and children (GeneaQuilts uses pie charts)
** Clicking on a person should show his/her details
** Geneaquilts has a timeline view
** Geneaquilts automatically zooms in or out when navigating from the
   overview canvas, to show the whole generation. Not sure whether this is
   convenient.

* Print
** Should hide unwanted parts of the page when printing

* FanChart
** Possibility to fold part of the fanchart to concentrate on specific
   families
   See www.cs.utah.edu/~draperg/research/fanchart/demo/
** Display SOSA number related to a given person
   Not necessarily related to the current root
** Display last name on a separate line to make it more readable
** Tooltip to display person info
** Rotation fan chart
   See https://plus.google.com/u/0/115195430424417504730/posts/QrXM4z9JxrG
** Half and Quarter circle view
   http://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=GEPS_030:_New_Visualization_Techniques
** Display rotated text (on a path)
   when HTML5 canvas supports it (it is now part of the standard, but not implemented
   by browsers yet)

* Person View
** DONE For each event, add an "downarrow" to show event details
   CLOSED: [2011-03-21 Mon 15:27]
   In particular, all personas that took part in the event.

* Person list view
** Slow to display with big databases
   If we paginate based on first letter of last name and only query those,
   it might be made much faster, and also easier to navigate.

* Styles

* Groups
** For: neighbor, friend, clergy, care-taker, and more

* Graphically editing the surety scheme
** DONE This scheme is properly taken into account when displaying assertions
   in the person view, but currently the user cannot edit it.
** Take these custom schemes into account when importing gedcom files

* Ideas for names
** Geneatica, Forebears, Testimony, Testimology

* Design
** Should we be using groups to store families ?
  Currently, a child belongs to a family through his birth (that gives his
  parents).
  But we have to create dummy personas sometimes to preserve the information on
  siblings (when none or only one of the parents is known).
  We could instead create a group "Family" in which personas are added as
  "child" or "father" or "mother".
  Main drawback is in the GUI, since we don't want users to have to create
  such a family every time. Perhaps when entering a birth event Geneapro could
  transparently create the group. Likewise, have dummy persona-to-persona
  relationships like "sibling", which are saved in the group rather than as
  assertions in P2P.

* Gedcom replacements
  Several models are proposed to replace Gedcom. Most of them share a number of
  characteristics with the GenTech datamodel that geneapro uses, but with
  slight differences. It would be useful to be able to export to one of those,
  and perhaps to even change the internal datamodel if a clear contender
  emerges.

    - how to partition the people into generational groups:
      * If possible, two married persons should be in the same group.
        This doesn't work for mythology for instance where a God could also
        have children with his kids. So likely a person should be in the
        same group as his/her oldest spouse.
      * Children are in the next group
