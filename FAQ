Q. How do I import my GEDCOM data ?

   Currently, GeneaPro is a read-only view. You should therefore
   have a GEDCOM file created by another genealogy software.
   Once you have this file, you should type the following command:
      make reset
      ./manage.py import gedcom.ged
   where the last argument is the path to your gedcom file.

   The first command is optional, and will reset the database. The
   second command will always add to the existing database
