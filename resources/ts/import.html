      <h2>Importing data into GeneaProve</h2>
   
      <p>
      At this stage, GeneaProve is mostly read-only. As such, we recommend importing
      data from an other genealogy software. In particular, the authors have tested
      imported from Gramps or Roots Magic.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Most genealogy software are capable of exporting your data as a <b>GEDCOM</b>
      file, which GeneaProve can then import to get you started.
      </p>
   
      <form gp-upload-form url='/data/import' (onupload)='onUpload($event)' #form='UploadForm'>
        <gp-upload-target [parent]='form'></gp-upload-target>
      </form>

         GeneaProve could not import your file.
         <br>
         This is either because your file does
         not contain correct GEDCOM data, or more likely because of limitations in
         GeneaProve. Please
         <a href="http://github.com/briot/geneapro/issues/new">Report</a>
         the issue to the GeneaProve developers. If your GEDCOM data contains
         information you wish to keep private, you can use the script
         <em>gedcom_anon.py</em> to anonymize the data before you send it to us.

         Your file was successfully imported, although some data might be missing.
         Check the output of the importer below:
