     <h2>Reports</h2>

     <p>
All genealogical software include <b>reports</b>. These are views into
your genealogical tree, showing various aspects.
</p>

<p>
<i>Geneaprove</i> currently only includes a limited number of views. These are

<ul>
  <li>A <b>Pedigree view</b>
      <p>
      Given a person (often called the <i>decujus</i>), the pedigree shows a
      tree of all its ancestors up to a number of generations.
      </p>
      <p>
      Geneaprove lets you configure the number of generations, and is comfortable
      showing all of them if you want. On my own genealogical tree, I have
      people up to the 21st generation (not all correctly verified yet!), and
      I can view the whole tree in my web browser in under a second, including
      time to download the data.
      </p>
      <p>
      Geneaprove will also show you the children of the <i>decujus</i>, to
      ease navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
      The pedigree view is fully zoomable, and will display more information
      as you zoom in.
      </p>
      <p>
      Clicking on any person in the tree will make that person the new
      decujus, and show his/her own tree.
      </p>
      </p>
      <p>Double-clicking on a person leads you to the Person view</p>
      <p>
      Since sources as so important in geneaprove, it will add a check mark
      next to all dates and places for which at least one source is available.
      </p>
      <p>
      The pedigree, like the fanchart, can be displayed with multiple color
      schemes:
      <ul>
         <li>
             <span class='images'>
                <a href="screenshots/pedigree4.png"><img src="screenshots/pedigree4.png"></a>
             </span>
             One is based on rules provided by the user, where the styling
             used for each person (background, text color, font,...) can be
             configured by creating <a href="highlighting.html">Highlighting
             rules</a>.
         </li>
         <li>
             <span class='images'>
                <a href="screenshots/pedigree3.png"><img src="screenshots/pedigree3.png"></a>
             </span>
             The second one will highlight based on the location of the
             person in the pedigree tree (generation and sosa number).
         </li>
         <li>
             <span class='images'>
                <a href="screenshots/pedigree5.png"><img src="screenshots/pedigree5.png"></a>
             </span>
             The third highlights purely based on the generation of the
             person.
         </li>
         <li>
             <span class='images'>
                <a href="screenshots/pedigree6.png"><img src="screenshots/pedigree6.png"></a>
             </span>
             The fourth does not draw any box, but is able to use more space
             to display details on the person.
         </li>
         <li>
             <span class='images'>
                <a href="screenshots/pedigree7.png"><img src="screenshots/pedigree7.png"></a>
             </span>
             The fifth uses one color for each of the grand-parents.
         </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      There are also several layout algorithms:
      <ul>
         <li>
             <span class='images'>
                <a href="screenshots/pedigree_expanded.png"><img src="screenshots/pedigree_expanded.png"></a>
             </span>
             One reserves space for all persons in the tree, even if that person
             is not known yet. It occupies more space, but might make it easier
             to follow a branch at a glance.
         </li>
         <li>
             <span class='images'>
                <a href="screenshots/pedigree_compact.png"><img src="screenshots/pedigree_compact.png"></a>
             </span>
             The second one is the compact mode, where unknown persons do not
             occupy any place on the screen.
         </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class='images'>
            <a href="screenshots/pedigree_not_same_size.png"><img src="screenshots/pedigree_not_same_size.png"></a>
         </span>
         In addition, you can configure whether all boxes should occupy the same
         space, or whether later generations are displayed smaller (thus leading to
         a better overview of the tree, and you can zoom in to see the details).
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class='images'>
         <a href="screenshots/pedigree_descendants.png"><img src="screenshots/pedigree_descendants.png"></a>
      </span>
      Finally, the pedigree can display both ancestors and descendants, up to as
      many generations as you want. The web client will only download the
      information it does not already have, to speed things up.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li>
      A <b>Fan chart</b>
      <span class='images'>
         <a href="screenshots/fanchart1.png"><img src="screenshots/fanchart1.png"></a>
         <a href="screenshots/fanchart2.png"><img src="screenshots/fanchart2.png"></a>
         <a href="screenshots/fanchart3.png"><img src="screenshots/fanchart3.png"></a>
         <a href="screenshots/fanchart4.png"><img src="screenshots/fanchart4.png"></a>
      </span>
      <p>
      Instead of displaying the ancestors as a tree, this report will
      show them in a circle. This is less frequently used, but is a much more
      compact way to see lots of generations in a single view.
      </p>
      <p>
      The same highlighting rules apply in the fanchart, although as seen in the
      screenshots it is also possible to use different color schemes, based for
      instance on the location of the person in the fanchart. This last
      colorscheme is less useful to investigate your data, but much nicer to
      print.
      </p>
      </li>

  <li><b>Quilts</b> view
      <span class='images'>
         <a href="quilts.png"><img src="quilts.png"></a>
      </span>
      <p>
      Quilts view have been introduced a few years ago by Aviz Research, and are a
      great way to see a lot of people interactively. See the
      <a href="http://www.aviz.fr/geneaquilts/">original paper</a>. Geneaprove does not
      provide the full functionality yet.
      </li>

  <li>A <b>statistics</b> view
      <span class='images'>
         <a href="stats1.png"><img src="stats1.png"></a>
      </span>
      <p>
      This page shows the number of persons in your tree (not the total
      number in the database, which very often is irrelevant because people
      include information for person whose name seem to match, just in case
      it is useful later).
      </p>
      <p>
      For each generation, it is able to display the earliest birth date and
      latest known death date. These are often useful to detect inconsistencies
      in the database.
      </p>
   </li>

   <li>A <b>Person</b> view
      <span class='images'>
         <a href="screenshots/person3.png"><img src="screenshots/person3.png"></a>
      </span>
      This view summarizes all knowns characteristics of a person, and all
      events to which she was part (either as the principal, or in any other
      role). When sources are available for these conclusions, hyper-links to
      the source view
      are displayed. This allows you to quickly see which conclusions need
      further sources.
      <p>
      It also shows the various persona that are linked together to represent
      a real world person, and will allow you to break these links when they
      are no longer valid. 
      <p>
      For each event or characteristic, the surety level of the assertion is
      displayed as a star ration. These schemes can be customized at will,
      so you can adapt to whatever your own conventions are.
      <p>
   </li>

   <li>A <b>List of persons</b> view
      <span class='images'>
         <a href="screenshots/persons3.png"><img src="screenshots/persons3.png"></a>
      </span>
      <p>
      This view lists all known persons in the database. The table can be
      sorted on any of the columns, or can be filtered to see a subset of
      the persons. Clicking on a person will lead you to the Person view.
      </p>
   </li>

   <li>A <b>Source</b> view
      <span class='images'>
         <a href="source1.png"><img src="source1.png"></a>
         <a href="source2.png"><img src="source2.png"></a>
      </span>
      This view describes a source. It shows all representations (images)
      associated with the source. Each representation can be scrolled and
      zoomed. It is also possible to perform a few basic transformations
      on the images (convert to black-and-white,...) hopefully to make
      them more readable.<br>
      In addition, the details of the source (name, repository,...) are
      displayed.</br>
      Finally, it shows all facts and assertions that were deducted from
      this source. There are few genealogical software that show this,
      although this is a very convenient way to see in one glance whether
      all information was extracted from that source, or whether you might
      have missed some part of it when you analyzed it.
   </li>
     
</ul>

<p>
The long term goal is to make creating such reports easier (at least when
dealing with exporting such reports). A good inspiration is
<a href="http://lifelines.sourceforge.net/">LifeLines</a>. Although a
text based tool (and which cannot import my Gedcom file :-(), it is known
for its good scriptability. One of its drawback is that the scripting
language was designed 20 years ago, and is very low-level. Thanks to python,
we can have a much more user-friendly language.
</p>
<p>
Geneaprove will need to include a high-level API (ie hiding the database
model), and then we can have reports exporting <b>Books</b>, <b>Trees</b>,
<b>List of people</b>,...
