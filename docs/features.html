     <h2>Features</h2>

<p>
Geneaprove only has a limited number of features currently, but hopefully
things will improve. Here is nonetheless a list of features that do
distinguish Geneaprove from other genealogy software (and the reason why
I started development on this project initially):
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>Web-based interface, local server</b><br>
   Geneaprove provides a web-based interface, that is you use it through
   your web browser. This allows you to access it from a lot of devices
   out there (Windows, Mac and Linux PCs, but also tablets,...). No need
   to install it on all those platforms.<br>
   But as opposed to some of the major-brand genealogy software, Geneaprove
   runs locally on your machine (or somewhere at a web-hosting company
   that you chose). You always have full access to your data. And since
   Geneaprove datamodel is documented, and the data stored in a standard
   sqlite database, you will be able to access it even if Geneaprove no
   longer exists.</li>

   <li><b>Unlimited number of generations in Pedigree</b><br>
   For some reason, a lot of software limits you to displaying three or
   four generation of ancestors at most on your pedigree. To see more,
   you have to select another person and display her ancestors. This
   isn't convenient, and machines nowadays are easily able to display
   much more than that.</li>

   <li><b>Both ancestors and descendants on Pedigree</b><br>
   Likewise, some software have two separate reports to show the ancestors
   and the descendants of a person (or in the best cases they display one
   generation of descendants along with the ancestors to ease navigation).
   <br>
   Geneaprove, on the other hand, uses a single view that combines the two,
   and you chose dynamically how many generations of each you want to
   display.</li>

   <li><b>No family events</b><br>
   Geneaprove gets away from the traditional notion of family in genealogy
   software. In some applications, if you want to see all the events for
   one person you have to see her personal events, then the events for
   each of the families she belonged to (with her parents and with her
   different partners).<br>
   When you research data, on the other hand, you generally concentrate
   on one person, not on a family. So Geneaprove really focuses on the
   person, and does not show the notion of family. Of course, to show
   a pedigree, Geneaprove will look at the parent-child or spouse relationships
   that might exist in your database, and recompute what is necessary.<br>
   A marriage is actually an event on which two persons have a "principal"
   role (husband and wife), and many others can have a "witness" role. This
   event is shared by all the persons, and only the roles distinguish the
   persons.</li>

   <li><b>Assertions</b><br>
   Most genealogy software allow you to store conclusions (Alan was born
   on 28-02-1900), but not the reasoning that lead to those conclusions.
   For instance, it is possible that as part of your reasearch you have
   found two documents that indicate 27-02-1900 and 28-02-1900 as dates
   of births. Some other document lead you to chose the second one as
   the most probable date. This choice should be explained, and the
   reasoning stored for when you go back to Alan in a few months or
   years).</li>

   <li><b>Source based</b><br>
   When we say that geneaprove is source based, we really mean it. You cannot
   enter an event or an assertion without a proper source to indicate where
   you got that piece of information from (even if the source is simply a
   "conversation with xxx"). So you can go back years later and examine the
   source again.</li>

   <li><b>Citation templates</b><br>
   Properly citing a source is for most of us a black art. I know I need to
   cite them so that I can find the source again a few years from now, but
   what amount of information is needed for that is not always obvious. Like
   several other genealogy software, Geneaprove therefore provides various
   templates to help. You select the type of the source, and geneaprove
   automatically provide input fields for the various citation parts, and
   from those computes the full citation.<br>
   For now, these templates are based on "Evidence Explained!" from
   Elizabeth Shown Mills, as provided by
   <a href="http://jytangledweb.org/genealogy/evidencestyle/">John Yates</a>.
   <br>
   Other templates can easily be added as strings, for instance
   <tt>${Author}, "${title}"</tt>.
   </li>

</ul>

<p>
This is open-source software, so feel free to contribute your ideas,
bug reports or wishes.
</p>

<p>
Some general questions and answers that are common to all reports:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>How is the information stored ?</b>
      <p>
   Although this might seem like a highly technical question of little
   concern to most people, it is actually very relevant. In most genealogy
   application, the information you entered is stored in a <b>proprietary</b>
   format. The only way to extract that information and import it in another
   software is to export in the GEDCOM format (and it is well known that this
   format is limited and cannot contain all the data that modern genealogy
   applications store).
      </p>
      <p>
   Some applications are able to directly import data from another
   application. The developers have done reverse engineering to try and
   understand the format, but there is no guarantee that this will always
   work.
      </p>
      <p>
   By contrast, Geneaprove stores everything in a standard SQL database (which
   you chose, it can be sqlite, postgreSQL, mysql,...). The schema of the
   database is fully public and documented, which means that there are lots
   of interfaces out there that gives direct access to the data (web, GUI,
   command line,...)
      </p>
      <p>
   Furthermore, Geneaprove is <b>open source</b>. This means that even if
   its developers cease to maintain or develop it, all is not lost. First,
   your data is still accessible as always. There is no license that
   expires. If you are a developer yourself, you can take over the
   maintainance. If you are not, you might be able to motivate other people
   to take over the maintainance.
      </p>
  </li>


  <li><b>Is there a limit to the number of persons in the database ?</b>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p>
   Geneaprove uses a real <a href="gentech.html">database</a>
   (postgreSQL, mySQL or sqlite) as its data storage, and they do
   not impose limits.
      </p>
      <p>
   Geneaprove is carefully optimized to limit the number of queries. For
   instance, to display the pedigree, it needs one query per generation
   in your whole tree (even in the parts that are not displayed), plus
   a few others to get the birth and death dates. Using style highlighting
   for the persons does not add more than a few extra SQL queries, so these
   are all pretty cheap, especially when the database is also running
   locally on the same machine.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Does geneaprove support same-sex marriages ?</b>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>
   A marriage is just an <a href="gentech.html">event</a> in which several
   people took part,
   just as in any other event. These persons are given a role in the
   event (for instance "husband" and "wife"), but nothing prevents you
   from either creating new roles ("partner"), or using two husbands or
   two wifes.
      </p>
      <p>
   Some events and roles plays a special part since they are used to
   display the pedigree and fan charts (father and mother of a child for
   instance).
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Does Geneaprove handle the implex ?</b>
      <p>
   The implex is one person appears several times in a pedigree (for
   instance, the same couple was the parents of two of your ancestors).
   Like all other genealogical software, Geneaprove will of course not
   duplicate data about those persons in the database. In addition, you
   can configure the highlighting styles so that a person that appears
   multiple times in the tree or fanchart visible on the screen gets
   special colors (background or foreground) and/or fonts. This makes
   it easier to see them immediately.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Does Geneaprove support sources ?</b>
      <p>
   Although support for sources is currently limited, Geneaprove will
   nonetheless show a special tick mark next to birth, marriage or
   death events when they have a proper associated source. This is
   a convenient way to find out which sources should be updated.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>What format should I use for dates ?</b>
      <p>
   Geneaprove supports multiple input formats for dates. In particular,
   the usual formats yyyy-mm-dd, dd-mm-yyyy, "yyyy mm, dd", as well as
   ambiguous formats like "about yyyy", "ca yyyy", "between yyyy-mm and yyyy".
   It also supports other calendars like Julian dates and the French
   revolutionary calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
   In fact, you are free to use any format you want, and geneaprove will
   store it exactly as is in its database, and print it exactly as. But
   it will try internally to make sense out of it, for sorting purposes.
   This is done automatically.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Will Geneaprove preserve accents and special characters ?</b>
      <p>
      Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
      Geneaprove's code is fully unicode-based. This means that all accented
      characters, asian characters and in fact any character you can currently
      type on your computer will be properly stored in the database, then
      manipulated by Geneaprove, and finally properly displayed on the web
      pages.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Does Geneaprove provide support for merging persons ?</b>
      <p>
      No.
      </p>
      <p>
      The idea is at the heart of the gentech datamodel that Geneaprove uses.
      Here, you
      create any number of personas, each representing a few aspects of a
      real-life person. For instance, if you find a birth record for John
      Smith, you create a persona (number 10 for instance) where you only
      record the date and place of birth (and of course, the source where you
      found that information!) If you then find a death certificate for a
      John Smith, you create another persona (number 11) where you only record
      the date and place of death, and the source.
      </p>
      <p>
      You then link the two personas 10 and 11 and indicate they represent
      the same physical person. That link should have a rationale that
      explains why these two personas are likely to be the same (in
      other software, this would be a merge operation, but here we can
      also provide and store an explanation for the merge).
      </p>
      <p>
      At this point, Geneaprove will only show one John Smith in the pedigree
      and the list of people. But this John Smith has both birth and
      death dates and places. So this is similar to <b>merging</b> in other
      applications.
      </p>
      <p>
      The real strength of the Gentech model, however, comes later. If at
      any point you find out that personas 10 and 11 are not the same after
      all, you can break the link we created earlier (and always with a
      rationale and source, if possible). Geneaprove goes back to showing two
      John Smith in the list of persons, one where the birth is known, the
      other where the death is known. If you ever want to link these again,
      Geneaprove will be able to tell you this is likely incorrect, and show
      you the rationale you provided before, thus preventing you from doing
      the same mistake again (or not...)
      </p>
      <p>
      The same possibilities exist if you want to undo a <b>gedcom import</b>.
      Only the personas imported from that gedcom are removed (along with
      their associated information). As a result, you are automatically back
      to where you were before, with the same information available in your
      database, without your having to worry about which information came from
      gedcom and should now be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
      In other applications, after the merge, there is no trace as to where
      each pieces of information came from. So you have to manually create
      a new John Smith, and manually copy some of the information from the
      merged one to the new one, then delete them from the merged one. And
      you are on your own to decide which information should be moved.
      </p>
      <p>
      When you import a Gedcom file, Geneaprove provides a checkbox that
      allows you whether you want to create a single persona for each person
      in the gedcom, or whether you want to create one persona for each
      source/person found in the gedcom, and automatically link these personas
      together.
      </p>
      <p>
      See <a href="gentech.html#merge">Gentech</a> for a technical explanation
      of the database.
