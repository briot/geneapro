     <h2>Gentech</h2>

<p>
The GenTech model makes for an interesting read, and is full of very good ideas
(of course, it was written by professionals).  However, there are a number of things
that I found under-described, and for which the software developer has to make guesses. 
</p>
<p>
The idea behind this model is that all genealogical assertions about a person or a place come from either a source or a previous insertion, and we want complete traceability from source to assertions.
</p>
<a href="datamodel.pdf" style="float:right">

<p>
Here is the database schema underneath geneaprove. We use a standard SQL database (django supports various DBMS, although by default geneaprove is configured for sqlite). The queries are carefully optimized to limit their count and keep geneaprove fast.

<h3>Individual sources</h3>

<p>
In GEDCOM, sources can be set directly on individuals, without going through
an event. This in general occurs when a person is cited in a source (so
we know her name, but not much else).
</p>
<p>
In Geneaprove, we store those as CENS (Census) events, using the source for
that event.
</p>

<h3>Event notes</h3>

<p>
In GEDCOM, notes can be associated with events. It isn't clear how these
are represented in the GENTECH data model.
It would be tempting to add the note into the name of the event, but then
this will be lost if we export to GEDCOM again. We do not add a
"comment/note" field to Event either, since this would not be linked
through an assertion (or a source).
</p>

<h3>Images for individuals</h3>

<p>
These are stored as characteristics of the persona.
Through the Persona-To-Characteristics table, there is a source which
is the image itself. Nice thing about this approach is that it provides
a convenient place to store dates and places for the image (in the
characteristic), as well as store where it was found and published (in
the source).
</p>

<h3>Families</h3>

<p>The concept of <b>Family</b> as found in gedcom does not exist in
Gentech. Such a concept is used in gedcom to store various pieces of
information: marriages or other unions between two adults, parents of
persons, and siblings. These can all be represented and computed
differently in Gentech</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Unions</b> between two persons are represented as a shared
events. Each of the two persons has a role "principal" for the event.</li>
  <li><b>Parents</b> of persons are found through a "birth" event, where
the child has a role "principal", and the parents have a role "father"
and "mother".</li>
  <li><b>Siblings</b> can be found by looking for persons that have
the same parents. This doesn't provide an ordering though (except by
birth dates when they are known). To handle such a case, Gentech
recommends creating a "children of..." group. Geneaprove currently doesn't
use this approach, but might at some point. The main issue is GUI related,
since we might not want to force users to manually create such groups.</li>
</ul>

There is a slight problem when importing, from gedcom, a family where one
or both parents are unknown. To preserve the "siblings" relationship between
the children, Geneaprove has to create personas for the parents, even though
no information is known about them. But that links the children together
through these parents. The group approach might be cleaner here.

Here are the possible other approaches to storing "child of" information:
<ul>
  <li>Create a Group called "children of X", and include Y in that group</li>
  <li>Create an assertion linking X as "father of" Y.<br>
      But apparently assertions between two personas are discouraged,
      except to indicate that two persons represent the same physical person.</li>
  <li> Create an event to represent the birth of Y.<br>
      Mark Y as having the "principal" role for this event,
      and "X" as having the role "father".<br>
      The advantage here is that the event also stores the location and date of the
      birth without having to duplicate that info elsewhere.<br>
      This is approach that was chosen in GeneaProve.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Merging personas</h3>

<p>
As explained in the <a href="features.html">Features</a> page, Geneaprove
does not support the merging of two persons. However, it does support a
way to link two or more personas to indicate they represent the same
physical person and thus the events and characteristics of both personas
should always be displayed together.
</p>
<p>
These links must be represented as <b>assertions</b>, so that we can
associate an optional <i>source</i>, a <i>rationale</i> to explain the
link, a <i>surety level</i>, a <i>disproved</i> attribute to indicate that
the two personas are definitely not the same, and so on.
</p>
<p>
The Gentech datamodel proposes an approach to representing these links
via a <b>group of personas</b>. Each of these groups represents a single
physical
person (so for instance the name of the group is "all personas for John Smith"
and its type is "samePerson"). Then each persona that store some events
or characteristics for John Smith is made a member of that group. At this
point, the <i>assertion</i> we were talking about is between a <i>persona</i>
and a <i>group</i> (a type of assertion specifically authorized by the
Gentech datamodel).
</p>
<p>This approach works well, even though graphically we should probably hide
the fact that there is a group underneath, and just have a "is same as"
assertion between two personas. It has however a few disadvantages.

<ul>
  <li>Efficiency is not excellent, because everytime we display one persona we
need extra queries to find the "sameAs" groups it belongs to, then search
all personas in that group, and the same for those new personas. Since
Geneaprove is meant to run locally on a user's machine, this drawback is not
major though, computers still have plenty of power to spare.</li>
  <li>The above efficiency issue is made more important because groups can
belong to groups. For instance, you assume that persona 10 and persona 11 are
the same because they share the same birth date and place. We also assume
that persona 12 and 13 are the same because they share the same marriage.
We then discover that 11 and 12 share the same death, and therefore
assume they are the same. Basically, the schema is as follows:
   <pre>
      10 and 11 (because they have same birth)    ---> Group 1
      12 and 13 (because they have same marriage) ---> Group 2
      Group2  (because 11 and 12 have same death) ---> Group 1

      (on the last step, we can also chose to create a Group 3 instead)
   </pre>
<p>
Ideally, if we disprove the "same death" assertion, we should end up
with two persons in the list (one is the result of grouping 10 and 11,
the other is the result of grouping 12 and 13). If instead we disprove
the "same marriage", we end up with two personas (one is 10+11+12, the
other is just 13).
</p>
<p>
That ideal behavior cannot be achieved if we create a single group for
all the personas, since we no longer know how they are connected
together. So we need groups inside groups (as is represented on the
schema above in fact). But one thing not visible on the schema, and
that cannot be represented with the groups, is that the "same death"
assertion is about 11 and 12. This is only visible in the rationale
text associated with the assertion, which Geneaprove cannot automatically
use.
<p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I therefore think the approach suggested by the Gentech authors is
incorrect. the "is same as" relationship is between two personas, not
between one persona and a group. This requires an <b>assertion</b>
between two personas, which gentech does not recommend (but doesn't
forbid either). The efficiency is comparable to the use of groups.
At this point, the schema above becomes:
</p>
<pre>
         10__
             \__same birth
         11__/
             \__same death
         12__/
             \__same marriage
         13__/
</pre>
<p>
On this new schema, it is clearer that if you break "same death", you
end up with two groups 10+11 and 12+13. If you break "same marriage",
you end up with two groups 10+11+12 and 13. So we have preserved the
full chain of reasoning. 10 and 13 are only related together through
a chain of assertions, and disproving any of these will simply unrelate
10 and 13.
</p>

<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<p>
A minor change was done to the handling of characteristics. In
geneaprove, a "Characteristic" has its own name, in addition to having
names characteristic_parts. This is useful when displaying multi-parts
characteristics (like a name, which is made of a given name, a surname,...).
Otherwise, when displaying the known information about a persona, there is
no easy way to show what a group of characteristic_parts is about.
</p>

<h3>Repositories</h3>
<p>
One source can be found in zero or more repositories; a repository can
contain zero or more sources. In practice, the repository information is
part of the full citation for a source (for instance see the book
"Evidence Explained!" by E. Shown Mills), so is stored as part of the
citation_part table in the Gentech model.
</p>
<p>
Duplicating that info into another set of tables for the repositories does
not bring much added value. In fact, one can assume that the same source
found in two different repositories will in general be a different copy
of the source, and so potentially a different analysis should be made.
Such a "duplicate" source could for instance be stored as a lower-level
source in a source hierarchy. 
</p>
<p>
The only interesting role given to a Repository, as described in the
Gentech data model, is that of storing access information (postal
address, schedules,...) and as part of a Search plan.
For now, Geneaprove therefore does not handle repositories as separate
entities.
</p>

<h3>Open questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>How to store images for places ?<br>
      We need to go through a source, to indicate where the image comes
      from. The source itself has a place, so we could simply create a new
      source, set it for that place, and associate representations for it.
      <br>
      Such a source is not linked to a person via an assertion, so we know
      it is stricly about its <i>subject-place</i> (field defined in GENTECH).
      <br>
      Such sources can be used to store the history of a place, old or
      recent images,...<br>
      However, this should not be used to store old names for places. In
      this case, GENTECH recommends storing the old name as a place of its
      own, with an existence-date. (But then I am not sure how to link from
      these historial names to the current corresponding places).
  </li>
  <li>Undoing an import</br>
      It should be possible to import a gedcom file in the database, analyze
      its contents in respect to the previous contents of the database, and
      for instance link personas through a "sameAs" relationship. At any
      point, we should be able to undo the import (or better to temporarily
      mark it as invalid), and view the database without it. That requires
      a tracing from database element (persona, events, assertions,...) to
      the gedcom import.<br>
      Currently, geneaprove (wrongly) uses a <i>Project</i> for that purpose,
      but it would be better to use a source (the gedcom file itself is the
      source). Then a general feature to disable a source (perhaps because
      its surety level is set to 0, or some such) would hide all information
      that came from that source (ie all assertions). There is no direct
      link from a persona or an event to a source, though, only through an
      assertion, so we wouldn't know exactly what to remove if we want to
      delete the source. Also, if an event had a source in the gedcom file,
      the Geneaprove importer will create two assertions for that event: one
      for the "gedcom file" source, and one for the source found in the
      gedcom. So the assertion will still be visible when we disable the
      "gedcom file" (which might be a feature, but doesn't provide an easy
      way to remove the events coming from gedcom)
   </li>
</ul>
