"""
Configuring styles to use when displaying people and events
Style rules have the following format:

this is a list of simple rules, each of which is one of:
  (RULE_EVENT, [event_test], css)
      and event_test is a list of tuples ("field", "test", "value")
         where "field" is one of "place.name", "date", "type_id",
               "age"   => age of the person at that event
               "count" => count of times where that test matched
           and "test"  is one of RULE_CONTAINS, RULE_IS,...
      These rules are tested once per event in which the person took part,
      whether as principal or as witness. As a result, they are more expensive
      to check than the RULE_ATTR tests.

  (RULE_ATTR, [tests], css)
      format is similar to EVENT, but these are tested on the person,
      not once per event. The "field" would be one of "surname",
      "age","ancestor", "ALIVE", "SEX", "UNKNOWN_FATHER", "UNKNOWN_MOTHER",
      "IMPLEX", "descendant", ...
      The "age" is computed from the person's birth, not checking whether that
      person is still alive.
      "ancestor" is true if the person is an ancestor of the person(s) given
      by the RULE_IS or RULE_IN test.
      "IMPLEX" is the number of times this person appears in the ancestor tree
      of the current person.

In all cases, css is similar to a W3C style description, ie a
dictionary of key-value pairs that describe the list. The keys
can be any of "color" (text color), "fill" (background color),
"font-weight", "stroke" (border color)...
